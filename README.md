Designing a general report card for a class

In this project, I built a general report card of a class. On this report card, we can see :

*The name of all the students;
*All the subjects taught in that class;
*The average of the class in each subject;
*The average of all the students;
*The average of the class;
*The first and last of the class, with their respective average.
